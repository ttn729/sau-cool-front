<h1>About Hidden Words</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Original website link: <a target="_blank" href="https://hidden-words.vercel.app/">Original Hidden Words</a></p>

<p>Hidden words was originally created to help language instructors prepare fill in the
    blank worksheets for their students. The idea is instructors will fill in two columns
    corresponding to the vocabulary words the students are learning and the meanings of those
    words.
</p>

<p>This version of hidden words has more up to date styling, and exists along other useful tools 
    compared to the standalone app I made before. 
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>The key feature of hidden words is the ability to randomly hide words and meanings,
    with the intent for the student to fill in these blanks as a vocabulary exercise.
</p>

<p>The printer friendly button toggles a printer friendly view of a worksheet, that instructors
    can easily print using Ctrl-p. Why not construct a pdf and download it for the instructor?
    The instructor I was working with wanted to be able to quickly use the same vocabulary word set
    to create multiple different copies for each of her students. She was also concerned about
    having a lot of files cluttering her computer so this seemed to be the most optimal solution for
    her use case.
</p>

<p>The number of lines to append adds lines at the end of the worksheet, allowing students to write
    down additional vocabulary words or focus on vocabulary words they are having difficulty with.
    The idea was to utilize the leftover white space on the page for this purpose. Unfortunately, this
    developer could not think of a way to dynamically determine how many extra lines are required to
    fill the rest of the page. For now, the number of lines to append exists as a way for instructors
    to manually add however many lines they want to add to the end of their vocabular words.
</p>

<p>The number of words to keep allows instructors to make worksheets using only a partial
    amount of words from word pack.
</p>

<p>The save button allows instructors to save their list of word meaning pairs into a word pack,
    that can be accessed later. In this way, instructors only have to enter in the data for their
    vocabulary lessons once and are able to make worksheets anytime with ease.
